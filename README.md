Clone the app and run it with:

```sh
yarn
webpack-dev-server
```

### Hints:

- The HTML skeleton of this puzzle is a table forming a grid of tiles
- You’ll may want to use the JavaScript properties `cellIndex` and `rowIndex` to find tiles position in the grid
- You can find a possible solution [here](https://github.com/gabrielecanepa/js-puzzle/blob/solution/lib/puzzle.js)
